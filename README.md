BlocklyBasedScriptGenerator - A Google Blockly based app that allows testers to easily generate test scripts for the
                              automated testing system. The reason for this side project was primarily to assist/simplify
                              the script generation/maintenance tasks of the tester.
                              The output of the app are script files that can be loaded into the automated test system.
